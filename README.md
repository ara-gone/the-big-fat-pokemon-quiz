My first (solo) frontend project.

# How does it work?

~~Why did you have to ask?~~

TBFPPQ uses its own classification system, labelling the monster according to its apparent properties - type/aesthetics/personality etc., but also taking into consideration factors such as release region, legendary status, animal species, and even base stats!
